# Electrons Around the Cores

## Project Overview
This project implements the game "Electrons around the cores" using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Pair Programming. The game is similar to ["Petals Around the Rose."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petals_Around_the_Rose)

## Best Software Engineers

## TODO List

### Set Up Project Environment
- Ensure Git repository is initialized and has `src` and `spec` directories.
- Create initial project files (`README.md`, etc.).

### Understand Game Rules
- Verify the rules for "Electrons around the cores" (similar to "Petals Around the Rose").

### Write Test Cases
- Write test cases for various inputs and expected outputs.
  - Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 6`
  - Example: `[2, 2, 3, 3] -> 4`
  - Example: `[6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3] -> 2`
  - Example: `[3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2] -> 12`

### Implement Function Skeleton
- Create the function skeleton in `src` directory (e.g., `calculate_electrons()`).

### Test Case: Input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Write a failing test for input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Write production code to pass the test.
- Refactor code if necessary.

### Test Case: Input `[2, 2, 3, 3]`
- Write a failing test for input `[2, 2, 3, 3]`.
- Write production code to pass the test.
- Refactor code if necessary.

### Test Case: Input `[6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3]`
- Write a failing test for input `[6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3]`.
- Write production code to pass the test.
- Refactor code if necessary.

### Test Case: Input `[3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2]`
- Write a failing test for input `[3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2]`.
- Write production code to pass the test.
- Refactor code if necessary.

### Additional Test Cases
- Write additional test cases to cover edge cases and other possible inputs.

### Final Refactor and Optimization
- Refactor the code for readability and performance.
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Clean up the code and add comments if necessary.

### Documentation
- Update `README.md` with usage instructions.
- Document the function and its purpose.

### Prepare for Submission
- Zip the Git repository.
- Upload to Moodle.
